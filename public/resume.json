    "summary": "I'm a software engineer in the Bay Area with broad experience working with JavaScript/React frontends and a variety of backends, including Ruby on Rails, ExpressJS, and AWS AppSync. I love working on all aspects of an app but I'm especially drawn to creating new components/pages on the frontend and working with business logic on the backend.\n\nPrior to software development, I was a project manager in the electric utility industry, where I coordinated the activities of 3 full crews. I've always built my own tools to solve specific problems (usually Excel calculators) and I took that a step further when I founded my own productivity app aimed at people working in the same position. In addition to honing my technical skills, this experience has taught me about making great UI/UX decisions, locking down information security, and making apps accessible to everyone.\n\nSome of my favorite technologies to work with include Google Cloud Platform's Firebase & Firestore, AWS S3, MongoDB, Express, React, Redux, NodeJS, Material UI, and GraphQL.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy traveling in the off-season, cycling along the Bay Trail, and tinkering with projects at ACE Makerspace in Oakland. I'm proudest of some of my woodworking projects, including a set of cherry wood bookshelf speakers and my dining room table.",

      "summary": "Paper presented to the Oxfam Novib Expert Meeting on Gender and Remittances.\nIn this study of the households of migrants living in Cebu City, we observed trends aligning with the two forms of migration, namely whether the husband/father or the wife/mother migrates. The former has the least effect on a household and its relations. Family members take over tasks when a man goes abroad, especially their wives, although the husband retains his role as main breadwinner. Male migration stimulates women to maintain their traditional roles as housewives, since the salary of the men increases by the migration and there is little need for additional income from the female spouses. Since the role of the women to be a mother and/or \"plain housewife\" is still favored by society (with much influence of the Catholic Church), this can be maintained when the income of the husband is sufficient to support this situation. Most men decide the amount of remittances that is send to their families back home, and in many cases, their spouses are not even familiar with the total salary. The large majority of women were not externally employed and they totally depend on the husband's foreign salary. Many women revealed their wish for a different career than being a full-time housewife, however the preference of their husband holds greater weight in this decision-making process. Within the household, the negotiation process does not change after migration, especially regarding expenditures. "

      "releaseDate": "2011-09-23",
      "website": "http://phillipgresham.com/docs/heroes-at-home.pdf",
      "summary": "Master's thesis.\nFilipino migration is characterized by taking up positions abroad that conform to gender roles, while nonmigrating household members take over the duties of the absent migrant. When those duties do not conform to one's gender role, one is less likely to perform the duty. In the case of a mother migrating, the father (who is \"traditionally\" seen as the main breadwinner, but not as the primary parent) is put into a position wherein he earns less than his wife and is expected to take care of the children. However, men are also commonly considered less capable of raising children, despite communications technology having advanced so that dual parenting can still be accomplished from abroad; fathers do not have to be seen as the only parents in this situation. The stigmatization that men experience as a result of their wives migrating has a serious effect on their feelings of masculinity and is further exacerbated by the \"New Heroes\" national script put forward by the government, which praises migrants as saving the nation while ignoring the equal (or greater) labor carried out in their absence. This thesis, built upon fieldwork conducted in Cebu City, disputes the widespread reputation of men as incapable fathers who rely entirely upon their wives' remittances, and advocates calling more attention to the gender- and vocation-biased praise of the New Heroes propaganda."

      "website": "http://phillipgresham.com/docs/cross-border-governance-western-sahara.pdf",
      "summary": "The decades-long struggle of the separatist Polisario organization in Western Sahara has resulted in one of the largest man-made border demarcations in the world representing a significant diversion of Moroccan monetary and social capital, ubiquitous military and peacekeeping presence, and increasing international pressure to resolve the situation diplomatically. Morocco's strict reaction toward (perceived) treasonous acts—including organizational activities in favor of autonomy such as distributing flyers or congregating, or even the legal registration of sympathetic human rights NGOs in the province—prevents the pro-independence Sahrawi from developing momentum. However, recent fiscal injections and reduced oppression by the ruling government have brought the territory's human rights and development levels on par with Morocco’s northern region, diminishing Sahrawi \"saber-rattling\" and shifting the local opinion from want of statehood to that of increased autonomy and a regional identity. While in the public eye it would appear the decision is left up to Moroccan and Sahrawi leadership, a few interested states formulate shared \"strategic planning\" behind the scenes (evidenced by leaked and declassified documents) to encourage democratic reform through selective incentives, suggesting a paternalistic relationship similar to Hardt and Negri's Empire, with Spain at the head. A successful resolution of this conflict—strongly desired by the UN, USA, France, ex-colonizer Spain, and neighboring states—would free up a large proportion of Morocco’s GDP spent on placing the military at the \"berm\", ease cross-relations within a number of Mediterranean states, negate the extension of a UN peacekeeping mission, and improve the human rights status of the region as a whole."

      "website": "http://phillipgresham.com/docs/mexican-american-border.pdf",
      "summary": "In this essay we shed light on the common contradictions and paradoxes that abound in the discourses (i.e. language and practices) regarding immigration from poor to rich countries. Within the context of the Mexican-American border, we explain the historical and material sources of American anti-immigrant attitudes—which could be extrapolated to other developed countries. We also talk about how the North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) illustrates the inconsistency between the anxiety to stop immigration and the eagerness to enjoy its economic benefits. We believe that this border case in particular exemplifies why borders still matter. Sometimes maps may depict arbitrary lines that make very clear-cut divisions between one country and another, even though those artificial lines do not represent real divisions of culture, institutions, economy, social norms, law enforcement, wealth or policymaking. However, we believe that the Mexico-U.S. border does in fact reflect an accurate reality because the differences from one side of the border to the other are striking. More generally, we aim at provoking a reflection regarding how foreign policy of immigration should not be separated from its political roots, which grow out from perceptions about social realities."
